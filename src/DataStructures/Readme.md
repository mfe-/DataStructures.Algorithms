# DataStructures (Work in Progress)

Contains the current datastructures

- The graphs datastructure with it vertices and edges is implemented as "linked list". 
  - The idea is that it is not neccessary to load the entire graph to execute an algorithm.
  - Each vertex can save a generic `Value`. This gives you the ability to save the data.
  - The graph is fully (de)serializeable.
- LinkedList (will be reimplemented [see](https://github.com/mfe-/Abstract.DataStructures.Algorithms/issues/3))
